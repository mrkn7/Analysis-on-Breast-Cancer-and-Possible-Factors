# Analysis-on-Breast-Cancer-and-Possible-Factors

There are 10 predictors, all quantitative, and a binary dependent variable, indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer.
The predictors are anthropometric data and parameters which can be gathered in routine blood analysis.
Prediction models based on these predictors, if accurate, can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer.
There's a story behind every dataset and here's your opportunity to share yours.

Using the variables, the possible effects of breast cancer were estimated and the classification accuracy was tested. 
In addition, variance relations were examined, PCA was performed, multivariate linear regression was constructed effectively.
